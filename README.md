## Jetstream Service Base
[Jetstream Documentation - https://jetstreamrfid.com/documentation/applicationapi/3](https://jetstreamrfid.com/documentation/applicationapi/3)
 
### Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 / Standard 2.0
The service base includes the ability to leverage the [Jetstream SDK](https://github.com/tersosolutions/JetstreamSDK-.NET) to get and remove events from Jetstream. Use those events to process inventory transactions in an application.

### Use the application or device API in a project
